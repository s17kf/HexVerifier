## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/s17kf/HexVerifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh

    ```

3. Build the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    mkdir cmake-build-debug
    cd cmake-build-debug
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the main application:
  ```sh
  ./cmake-build-debug/Hex
  ```

To run unit tests:
  ```sh
  ./cmake-build-debug/tests/BoardTests
  ./cmake-build-debug/tests/DataStructuresTests
  ./cmake-build-debug/tests/UtilsTests
  ```

All unit tests can be run with:
  ```sh
  ./tests/unit_tests.sh
  #(This script checks for memory leaks as well)
  ```

Functional tests can be run with:
  ```sh
  ./tests/test.sh
  #(To enable memory leak checks, use the -v flag)
  ```
